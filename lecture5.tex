\section{Codon optimisation}
Recall the redundant mapping from codons to amino acid and the basic structure of a bacterial gene. In prokaryotes functionally related genes are often grouped in operons\footnote{a unit made up of linked genes which is thought to regulate other genes responsible for protein synthesis.}.
\subsection{Introduction to codon optimisation}
The amino acid code is redundant. Different organisms have different preferences for particular codons.
